# Reflection

## 1. How did you approach creating more flexible functions with parameters? 

### I researched and learned more about Higher Order Functions.I am not entirely comfortable with them yet but they were key in creating events for keypresses and buttons.

## 2. What challenges did you face while incorporating conditional logic in your functions?

### Figuring out how to simplify the checkEligibility and use Nested Conditions and I'm still a bit confused. lol


## 3. How does refactoring improve the readability and maintainability of your code? 

### Seems like it makes it clearer and more simplified.

## Lab 2:

## 1. How did array methods like push() and filter() help you manipulate data in this activity? Push was helpful for adding items to the shopping list and filter for the types of items added.


## 2. What challenges did you face when trying to filter and search for items in the array? 

### ALOT! I actually still don't understand how to add filter criteria like most websites have.


## 3. How would you modify this code to make it more efficient or user-friendly?

### Allow for partial matches and filters when searching. E.g. Price Range, Departments, or availability.
